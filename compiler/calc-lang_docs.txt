Calc-lang is a simple, essentially made up as far as i know, programming language for the Liu course TDDE24, assignment 6

ENBF -------------------------------------

Program = 'calc', Statements

Statements = Statement | Statements

Statement = 
        Assignment
      | Repetition
      | Selection
      | Input
      | Output

Assignment = 'set', Variable, Expression

Repetition = 'while', Condition, Statements

Selection = 'if', Condition, Statement | 'if', Condition, Statement, Statement

Input = 'read', Variable

Output = 'print', Expression

Expression = 
        Constant
      | Variable
      | Binary_expression

Condition = Expression, Conditional_operator, Expression

Binary_expression = Expression, Binary_operator, Expression

Conditional_operator = < | > | =

Binary_operator = * | + | - | /

Constant = int | float

Variable = any alphabetical(latin) string not containing numbers

Extra rules and stuff -----------------------------------------------

Program, Statement, Condition, and Binary_expression's must be contained within brackets []
